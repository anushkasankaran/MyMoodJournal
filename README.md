<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I've struggled with mental health before. Everyone has their ups and downs when it comes to their mental health. About a year ago, I had a burnout where I started to lose interest in everything I did. At that time, I wanted nothing but to feel better. Something I found helpful was tracking my mood and looking back on how it has changed. This helped me understand some of the causes and feel proud of myself for every improvement I made.

### Built With
